            Today we're going to examine the "F Pattern Layout". Rather than trying to force the viewer's visual flow,
            the F-Layout gives in to the natural behaviors of most web surfers and it uses scientific studies to back it up.
           This tutorial will walk you through the principles of the F-Layout, why it works, and how you can create your own.

            The F-Layout relies upon various eyetracking studies for it's foundational concept. These scientific studies show that web
            surfers read the screen in an "F" pattern - seeing the top, upper left corner and left sides of the screen most...
            only occasionally taking glances towards the right side of the screen. These eyetracking studies argue in favor of placing
            the most important elements of your site (branding, navigation, call to action) on the left side of the design.

            This technique of "breaking the expectations" of the layout can be useful when you have really long vertical spans of content
            that feel dull or boring once you scroll past the first couple headlines. By throwing the viewer a curveball, you can keep
            the users moving around your site by providing visually interesting elements 1000, 2000, even 3000 pixels below the fold.
