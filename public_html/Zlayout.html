            The premise of the Z-Layout is actually pretty simple: super-impose the letter Z on the page.
            Place the items that you want the reader to see first along the top of the Z.

            The eye will naturally follow the path of the Z, so the goal is to place your "call to action" at the end. All along the
            path you can include bits of information that build up to the call-to-action.

            It's important to note that the Z-Layout isn't the only layout paradigm that's out there. Heck, there are about as many layouts
            as there are letters in the alphabet. The Z-Layout is one of the principle layouts because
            it's so simple to use as a foundation, but you'll always want to trust your instincts when it's time to make a final layout decision.
